# Reported reviews so far

1. ~~For the device location we should use GPS coordinated~~
2. ~~For the customer address we should add annuani ya makazi~~
3. ~~For the supplier it can remain as it is~~
4. The system should have two mode in graphics here I am referring to the light mode which it is operating one and the dark mode for night operation (the software if too bright in night)
5. When using phone the software doesnâ€™t fit precisely in the phone screen
6. ~~Prediction to time cylinders will remain empty is not included~~
7. Filter and cluster of customers according to the time remaining for cylinders to remain empty
8. ~~The prediction should be so friendly to enable the supplier use this prediction to forecast how they acquire inventories (it can even be in a form of pictorial presentation i.e. graph)~~
9. The route suggestion should also cluster orders which happen to appear along the way. This is to enable supplier in supplying more than one cylinder along the way
10.
