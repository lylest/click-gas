To predict when your cooking gas will run out based on the data you've provided, you can use a simple linear regression formula. Linear regression assumes that the gas consumption is changing at a constant rate. The formula to predict when the gas will run out is:

Predicted Days Remaining
=
Current Gas Level (in kg)
−
Final Gas Level (in kg)
Average Daily Gas Consumption (in kg/day)
Predicted Days Remaining= 
Average Daily Gas Consumption (in kg/day)
Current Gas Level (in kg)−Final Gas Level (in kg)
​


In your case, you can calculate it like this:

Current Gas Level (in kg): 11 kg (as per your last reading).
Final Gas Level (in kg): 0 kg (when it runs out).
Average Daily Gas Consumption (in kg/day):
